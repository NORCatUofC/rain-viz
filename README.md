### Tentative Outline

* Main visualization showing a timelapse of several significant storms, with
the storm distribution, CSO events, river reversals, and 311 calls about flooding
showing the combined impact of more intense rainfall.
* Detail pages with separate visualizations explaining each issue with explanations
of what they are and their implications
