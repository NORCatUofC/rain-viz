  <h3>More Intense Storms</h3>
  <p>The "n-year storm" (i.e. 5-year storm, 50-year storm) is a measure for
  estimating how often severe storms should happen. Essentially, a 50 year storm
  is a storm that has a 2% chance of happening in any given year over a 100 year
  period.</p>
  <p>While it's not something most people would have heard of, it definitely has
  consequences, particularly in planning new infrastucture. New construction projects
  like sewers are often designed with the assumption that a storm as severe as a
  100 year storm should only happen about once every 100 years.</p>
  <p>The idea of the n-year storm makes sense for planning, except for one thing:
  <a href="http://www.isws.illinois.edu/atmos/statecli/RF/rf.htm" target="_blank">it hasn't been
  updated for this area since 1992</a>. Since then, climate change has dramatically
  changed weather patterns around the world, and the Chicago area is no exception.</p>
  <p>The Chicago area has had <i>3 100-year storms in the past 46 years alone</i>,
  2 of which happened in the 10 years. And it's not just the 100 year storm, we've
  seen multiple 25 and 50 year storms as well.</p>
  <h3>Sewer Overflows</h3>
  <p>The sewer system in Chicago is one of the main pieces of infrastructure designed
  based partially off of estimated n-year storm levels. N-year storm levels shape
  how much sewage they're designed to handle at a given time. When they're overwhelmed,
  as they often are by rain during a severe storm event, the sewage has to go
  somewhereâ€”often back in the Chicago river.</p>
  <p>When this happens, it's called a combined sewer overflow (or CSO), and it's
  performed by Chicagoland water management agencies to prevent flooding. There
  have been efforts to prevent them, so they haven't increased as quickly as storm
  intensity has over time, but planning is still based on outdated estimates of
  precipitation.</p>
  <h3>Basement Flooding</h3>
  <p>Combined sewer overflows are intended to stop flooding, but in different areas
  across the city they're not always successful. This leads to basement flooding
  throughout Chicago that can often lead to serious property damage.</p>
  <p>While Chicago isn't the first place associated with flooding, basement flooding
  is a serious problem for many residents. In particular, flooding seems to be
  concentrated in lower-income neighborhoods in the South and West sides of the
  city. City government and other organizations have created multiple efforts,
  <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/water/supp_info/basement_floodingpartnership.html"
  target="_blank">notably the Basement Flooding Partnership</a> and <a href="http://www.cnt.org/projects/rainready"
  target="_blank">the Center for Neighborhood Technology's RainReady program</a>
  to address this, but it remains a persistent problem, especially in these neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>Although there are no clear answers to exactly why flooding is concentrated
  lower-income neighborhoods, the answers may not lie entirely with weather or the
  sewer system. Further research is needed, but there are notable correlations
  with some indicators of building quality in a neighborhood, including building
  values and the number of foreclosures over time. <a href="/flooding">See a map
  of basement flooding across the city here</a>.</p>
